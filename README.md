I am by no means anything but a Python Adventurer and novice.  I would like to be considered a Python Wizard, Guru, Professional.  I have seeked guidance on how to get there... and I found this Stack Exchange posting, which outlines a decent basic approach.  What I liked about it, is that my approach to wanting to learn came out of desire (I want to be more then just an artist, deisgner or professional in the Game Development arena, I want to have a fundamental kowledge base about the Computer Science aspect of it as well) and my stab in the dark appraoch to learning, pretty much lead me down the very path laid out here (and I felt the laying out of the answer in a Pythonic way was fun and creative):

<CODE>
def apprentice():
  read(diveintopython)
  experiment(interpreter)
  read(python_tutorial)
  experiment(interpreter, modules/files)
  watch(pycon)

def master():
  refer(python-essential-reference)
  refer(PEPs/language reference)
  experiment()
  read(good_python_code) # Eg. twisted, other libraries
  write(basic_library)   # reinvent wheel and compare to existing wheels
  if have_interesting_ideas:
     give_talk(pycon)

def guru():
  pass # Not qualified to comment. Fix the GIL perhaps?
  
</CODE>

At one point, I had started collecting all of the various readings, materials, web links and knowldge I stumbled across along the way into part of my hog_SKELETON project (I project to learn the best way to structure and design a project, with distribution, packages, models, etc.) And in order to allow me to keep that project focused on that goal, I have gotten to a poitn I am cleaning it up and dplsitting it all off so it can remain more pure... it will be just a starting point and a functional development sandbox, with maybe a template to guide that strucutre of whatever sort of project I want to build it into (like my openGL model viewer).  

This is going to become the space for me to gather up all of my learning tools, examples, etc.
